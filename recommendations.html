      <h1>Whats Next?</h1>

      <h3>The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted many pitfalls<br> of the aviation industry, and provides NASA an
        opportunity to refocus the industry’s direction as it looks to the future. (+ some more text)</h3>

    </div>


    <div class="Passenger_Health">
      <h1>Passenger Health</h1>
      <p>COVID-19 has created new passenger safety demands, as passengers are concerned with human contact, airflow, and
        other health demands. Similar to the security measures implemented after 9/11, the passenger experience is
        changing once again, and NASA must research technologies crucial in allowing the aviation industry to regain its
        credibility as a safe method of transportation.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="Future_aircraft_designs">
      <H1>Future aircraft designs</H1>
      <p>NASA must continue to develop alternative aircraft designs, continuing current projects relating to supersonic
        flight, Urban Air Mobility (UAM), vertical takeoff, environmentally conscious aircraft, and more.
        <br><b>Supersonic:</b> NASA is currently developing supersonic aircraft technology that will drastically reduce flight
        times. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, passengers are hoping to experience an efficient travel journey, from
        streamlined airport experiences to shorter flights, as passengers want to reduce the amount of time they are
        potentially exposed to the virus. This notes a potential market for supersonic aircraft in the future. NASA must
        continue to research supersonic technology, as the field still faces many technical and social challenges.
        <br><b>UAM</b>: UAM has had success during the COVID-19 pandemic, accelerating through regulations and has emerged as a
        potentially preferable means of transportation during pandemics due to the reduced human contact it offers. NASA
        must continue to heavily invest in UAM technology, as we can expect an emergence in small and large UAM in the
        future.</p>

    </div>



    <div class="System_management">
    <h1>System management</h1>
    <p>NASA must strive to support the restructuring and revitalization of the aviation industry, and must develop infrastructure to support the next generation of revolutionary aircraft. As supersonic aircraft, UAM, commercial spacecraft, and other non-traditional aviation operations emerge, advanced air traffic management systems will be needed to safely integrate other revolutionary technologies to the traditional airspace currently in place. The continuation and expansion of current NASA ATM and system management platforms like TestBed will be crucial as the air transportation becomes more complex.</p>

</div>

<div class="Support_of_disruptive_innovators">
<h1>Support of disruptive innovators</h1>
<p>As a national system, NASA must work to adapt to the changing state of air transportation development: expanding beyond the traditional manufacturers like Boeing, Airbus and Lockheed Martin, but also supporting growth of tech companies and startups, which are innovating quickly and disrupting traditional operations. Industry success is reliant on all contributors, and NASA must provide a platform for innovative development.
</p>
</div>


<div class="Automation">
<h1>Automation</h1>
<p>Over the next few decades, many aspects of the world as we know it will become automated, including the many parts of the aviation industry. COVID-19 has propelled the innovation and implementation of automated technologies due to the desire for interactions without any human contact. However, there are few fully automated technologies currently on the market, and demand for modernized aviation systems and autonomous technologies in every sector will greatly increase in coming years. NASA must continue to research automated technologies to help aviation adapt to the changing globe.</p>

</div>


<div class="Environment">
<h1>Environment</h1>
<p>Despite NASA’s progress in improving aviation’s massive environmental impact, more research and development is needed in the next few years to ensure that sustainable aircraft are quickly developed as the global climate crisis approaches. To truly achieve decarbonization, NASA must continue to research both evolutionary and revolutionary aircraft technologies, as evolutionary technologies (retrofits and improvements to current aircraft designs) will provide short term improvements, while revolutionary technologies (completely new aircraft design) will enable long term, large scale impact.</p>
