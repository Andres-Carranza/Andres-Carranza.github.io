            1990-2001: The Gulf War and a Weakened Industry
          </div>

          <div class="summary">
            At the start of the 90s, the outlook was not too bright for the air travel industry. Many airlines were suffering various setbacks that resulted in the industry experiencing major losses. The Gulf War of 1993 and ensuing recession was the breaking point for most, with big names like  Pan Am going under. Nevertheless, as the economy recovered  from the recession, so did the air travel industry. Operating net profits  for the industry overall were positive for the first time since the 80s in 1994, and profits experienced steady growth for the remainder of the decade. However, a worsening economic climate at the turn of the millenium led to profits decreasing once again, leaving the industry in a weakened condition for the devastating crises that were yet to come.

            2001: The September 11 Terrorist Attacks
          </div>

          <div class="summary">
            The hijacking of four commercial jetliners on September 11th, 2001, was one of the most impactful events in aviation history. The terrorist attacks sent the industry into disarray, making an already meek outlook worse. In addition to a temporary massive reduction in air travel demand, 9/11 forever changed the industry’s dynamics. The implementation of the TSA across all major US airports meant that flying was no longer as simple as it once had been. Now, passengers had to suffer through the hassle of long security lines. This drove away a lot of demand as people were starting to choose other simpler methods of transportation over flying. The decrease of demand drove many airlines out of business, including heavyweights such as Transcontinental, and cost thousands their jobs as airlines were forced to make massive layoffs.

            2002-2007: A Healing Industry
          </div>

          <div class="summary">
            Post 9/11, the air travel industry went through many changes as airlines were forced to adjust to the new economic climate. With many airlines cutting their workforces, the air industry no longer had the capacity it did before 9/11 and thus many small regional flights were cut. Additionally, the major carriers shifted their flying capacity from the domestic market to the international market in search of profitability. These factors gave low cost carriers such as Southwest a chance to increase their market share. The surge of low cost carriers hitting the market led to fares being driven down, straining the already weakened major carriers. Nonetheless, the air travel industry was able to persevere through all the challenges it was facing, and by the mid 2000s  many airlines were already seeing a return to profitability. However, this era only served to be the calm before the storm that was the global financial crisis.

            2007-2009: The Great Reccesion

          <div class="summary">
            The global financial crisis, also known as the Great Recession  had economic repercussions that impacted virtually every industry. However, the aviation industry, which is known to be more susceptible to economic conditions than other industries, was especially devastated during this period of economic downturn. With air travel demand plummeting, airlines were forced to completely rethink how they were operating in order to stay afloat. Many airlines completely revolutionized their business models, introducing ancillary revenues, cutting smaller flights, and leasing airplanes instead of buying them. These and many other changes made by the industry in response to the Great Recession helped airlines emerge from this crisis on track for a profitable future.

            2010s: The Return of Prosperity to Aviation
          </div>

          <div class="summary">
            Although airlines across the industry had made substantial changes during the Great Recession to maximize profitability, the lack of demand during the recession had caused the industry to shrink. Because of this, for the first five years following the recession the industry experienced relatively slow growth. However, in 2014 with the recession mostly in the rearview mirror, air travel demand growth started picking back up and remained high for the rest of the decade. The consistent growth in demand meant that most airlines finished the decade with great profit margins, setting high hopes across the industry for what was to come.

            The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented impacts on every sector in every country across the globe.  However, the air travel industry has been especially hit hard by the pandemic, with the downturn in air travel demand being deemed the "Great Travel Depression”. The virus has caused a tremendous decline in airline operations, dwarfing any impact other crises have had to the industry in the past. Aircrafts have been grounded across the country, flights canceled, and aviation staff laid off.
