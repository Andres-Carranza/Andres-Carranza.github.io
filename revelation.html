          The US air transportation system is large and complex, consisting of many various operations and programs to ensure efficient and safe flight. Aviation is a multi faceted industry, consisting of multiple sectors including: passenger travel, cargo/air freight travel, manufacturing, and management of the National Airspace System. Each sector comes with its unique features and challenges, and connects to the larger air transportation system.
          <br><br>
          The aviation industry has an <strong>enormous economic impact</strong>, influenced by passenger aircraft fares, price of manufactured aircraft parts, spending by visitors that travel by air transportation, and more. In fact, civil air manufacturing was <strong>the US’ largest net export</strong> in 2016. Combined with its associated sectors, civil air transportation: accounts for <strong>5.2% of the US’ GDP</strong>, supports 10.9 million jobs, and contributes about 1.8 trillion dollars in total economic activity each year.
          <br><br>
          Over the last few decades, air transportation has become a <strong>necessity in American daily</strong> life. Air transportation allows passengers to visit new places, attend business meetings, see loved ones, deliver e-commerce packages, keep retail stores stocked, and more. The US air transportation system carried almost a billion passengers in 2019, and both the system and US airlines have experienced <strong>consistent growth in operations</strong>. The aviation industry is cyclical, <strong>heavily dependent on the economy</strong>, and US airlines have adapted to new methods to ensure profit, including ancillary revenue and mergers and acquisitions. These efforts have been widely successful - in 2018, US airlines <strong>gained revenue for the 10th year in a row</strong>. The aviation industry continues to adapt to the challenges of the expanding air transportation system and to handle demand as it increases each year.
