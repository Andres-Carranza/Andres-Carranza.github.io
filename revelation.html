        <p>
          Team Revelation is a part of NASA's Ames Research Center Aviation System's Division summer internship program. The team was tasked with analyzing Covid-19's impact on aviation, and developing predictions for the outlook of the industry as well as coming up with recommendations regarding what NASA's aerospace research should focus on as a response to the pandemic. The team was overseen by Kee Palopo and Divya Bhadoria, both researchers at Ames' Aviation System's Division. You can view the team's final presentation <a href="documents/presentation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
